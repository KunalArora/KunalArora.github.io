Contribution of team members to the visualization Assignment 8: Implementing the basic layout for your project

Initially, both team members brainstorm about different visualization ideas based on the reviews from peer students and after
discussion in the last class with the professor. Also, we both developed different individual sketches to be able
to discuss later with one another.

My initial idea was to show a US map so, a user can see and interact for drug addiction data on a state level. Also, to show
the data of different drug categories for different age groups to understand which age-group is most affected.

For the created visualizations, I was responsible for designing the overall layout of the website like, the positioning of text,
legends, deciding upon the bases of the size of different rectangles, circles etc.
Also, majorly I implemented the interaction of the age demographic graph which is displayed once, a user clicks on one of the
drug rectangular box. I also, decided upon the color scheme of the website and different color combinations displaced in the
age-group distribution graph.
